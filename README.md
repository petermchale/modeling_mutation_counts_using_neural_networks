# Model 

[Here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petermchale/modeling_mutation_counts_using_neural_networks/blob/master/engineer_features/model/model.ipynb) is a description of the model, with properly rendered Plotly interactive graphs. 

# Applications

* Project 1: Fit the model to de-novo mutation data to see how mutation rate varies with genomic coordinate. 

* Project 2: Fit the model to germline and somatic variation data. Then infer genomic regions under negative or positive selection by identifying regions in which the mutation count is lower or higher than expected under the trained model.
